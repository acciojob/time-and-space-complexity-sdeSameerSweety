	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the efficiency of algorithms. In simple terms, time complexity tells us how much time an algorithm will take to run as a function of the size of the input data.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another important factor to consider while writing an algorithm. Space Complexity refers to the total amount of memory that an algorithm or a program requires to run. The term "O(n)" is used to express the amount of memory it needs.</p>
