	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures algorithm efficiency in terms of input size.Time complexity refers to the measurement of the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size increases. Efficiency, in terms of time complexity, aims to minimize the execution time of an algorithm.

</p>
	<p>Space Complexity O(n) refers to the linear growth of memory usage.<b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory consumed by an algorithm during its execution. With a space complexity of O(n), the amount of memory required grows linearly with the input size.
