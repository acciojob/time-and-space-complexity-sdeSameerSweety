	<h1>Time And Space Complexity</h1>
		<p>Time Complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. It's usually expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the time complexity in the worst-case scenario.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> on the other hand, is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run. It's also expressed using Big O or O(n) notation and it includes both Auxiliary Space and space used by the input.</p>
